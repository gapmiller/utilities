# utilities

Miscellaneous utilities that I wrote in the process of learning Python and C.

Windows:
  
  dir_list.py - returns a list of subdirectories from the specified directory (currrently hard coded). Most of it is from an answer in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/800197/get-all-of-the-immediate-subdirectories-in-python

Note that I am storing scripts that I wrote and use for Windows and for Linux, and I'm storing all my utilities locally in my Linux box. As a result the Windows CRLF characters have been replaced by Linux LF characters. I have not yet researched exactly how to fix this. If anybody does use these utilities, beware that there might be glitches as a result. More info can be found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf
